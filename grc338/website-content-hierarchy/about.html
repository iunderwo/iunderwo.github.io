            <p>Welcome! My name is Isabella, but I'm better known by my nickname Izzy.</p>
            <p>Baking has been a passion of mine for as long as I can remember. I am so grateful that I've been able to turn my passion into a quaint, family-owned business.</p>
            <p>With an array of handmade drinks, baked goods and deli sandwiches, Izzy's Bakery is the perfect spot to grab a quick bite to-go or relax outside on the patio.</p>
