            <h1>Final project proposal</h1>
            
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            
            <p>Gosha Records</p><!--Change it to the name of the company-->
            
            <p>Gosha Records is a record store located in Oakland, California. Here at Gosha, our priority is to offer as wide of a variety of music possible. We'll buy records off of you! We also love supporting local bands, and host concerts for up-and-coming artists every Thursday night.</p><!--Short description of the company-->
            
            <h2>Target audience</h2>
            
            <p>Our target audience is individuals who are passionate about music and want to discover artists they have never heard of. This can range from teenagers to older generations. Because of this, we aim to keep the website as simple and user-friendly as possible, while still maintaining the aesthetic shown throughout our store.</p><!-- Who are the people who use this site? -->
           
            <p>Since our store is near a local community college, we hope to attract more young adults through the website. Eventually, we want Gosha Records to become the go-to spot for the youth to hang out and explore different genres of music. </p><!-- What are their primary task and goals? -->
